# BuildPulse Example Project: Ruby + minitest

This is an example [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you identify and eliminate flaky tests.

If you have an existing minitest project building on **GitHub Actions CI**, this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-ruby-minitest/compare/73aef46...github-actions) shows how to set up your GitHub Actions workflow to send test results to BuildPulse.

If you have an existing minitest project building on **CircleCI**, this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-ruby-minitest/compare/73aef46...circle-ci) shows how to set up your `.circleci/config.yml` to send test results to BuildPulse.
